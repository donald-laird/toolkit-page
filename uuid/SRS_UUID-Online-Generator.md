## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Purpose

This document provides a detailed specification for the "UUID Online Generator" web application, covering its functional and non-functional requirements. The core objective is to offer users a clean, ad-free, efficient, and secure client-side tool for generating UUIDs.

### 2.2 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Core Functionality: Online generation of customizable Version 4 UUIDs.
    
- Platform Compatibility: Responsive support for modern desktop and mobile browsers.
    
- Deployment: To be deployed as a pure static web page.
    

**Out of Scope:**

- Backend Interaction: All generation logic is performed client-side via JavaScript. No data is exchanged with any server.
    
- User Account System: No registration or login is required.
    

### 2.3 Target Audience

- **Developers/Testers:** Technical users who need to quickly obtain single or bulk UUIDs during development or testing.
    
- **General Users:** Non-technical users who need to generate unique identifiers for various purposes.
    

## 3. Overall Description

### 3.1 Product Vision

To create a minimalist and highly responsive online tool that allows users to instantly generate compliant UUIDs and seamlessly integrate them into their workflows through convenient copy and export features.

### 3.2 User Story

"As a developer, I want to be able to bulk-generate a list of UUIDs based on a specified quantity and letter-casing rule, so that I can quickly copy a single result or all results for use in my application."

## 4. Functional Requirements (FR)

|ID|Feature Name|Description|Priority|
|---|---|---|---|
|**FR001**|**Specify Quantity**|- The user can input an integer to specify how many UUIDs to generate. - **Constraint:** The value must be an integer ≥ 1 and ≤ 100. - **Default Value:** 5|High|
|**FR002**|**Letter Case**|- Provides three options: "Lowercase", "Uppercase", and "Random". - **Constraint:** Radio buttons, select one of three. - **Interaction:** "Lowercase" or "Uppercase" sets the case for all generated UUIDs uniformly. "Random" decides the case for each UUID individually. - **Default Value:** "Lowercase"|High|
|**FR003**|**Generate UUIDs**|- A prominent "Generate UUID" button is available. - **Logic:** 1. Validate all user inputs. 2. If invalid, display an inline error message and clear the results area. 3. If valid, generate the list of UUIDs in the results area according to all settings.|High|
|**FR004**|**Copy Operations**|- **Copy Single:** An individual copy icon button is placed next to each generated UUID. - **Copy All:** A "Copy All" button allows copying all results to the clipboard, with each UUID on a new line. - **Feedback:** On success, a short-lived toast notification ("Copied to clipboard") appears.|Medium|
|**FR005**|**Export Operation**|- An "Export TXT" button allows the user to download all results as a `uuids.txt` file. - **Feedback:** On success, a toast notification ("Exported to uuids.txt") appears.|Medium|
|**FR006**|**Information Section**|- An info section at the bottom of the page describes the tool's purpose, benefits, and emphasizes its client-side security.|Low|
|**FR007**|**Error Handling**|- When user input violates a constraint, a clear and helpful error message appears in red text directly below the relevant input control, instead of using a browser alert.|High|
|**FR008**|**Project Source Link**|- A GitHub icon is provided at the bottom center of the page. - **Interaction:** Clicking the icon opens the project's source code repository in a new browser tab.|Low|

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

|Category|Requirement Description|
|---|---|
|**Performance**|The page must load quickly. All interactions (e.g., generation, copying) must feel instantaneous with no noticeable delay.|
|**Reliability**|The application must have robust error handling to gracefully guide the user toward correct input.|
|**Usability**|The interface must be intuitive, with a conventional layout. A new user should understand how to operate it within seconds without guidance.|
|**Compatibility**|The responsive design must ensure a consistent and flawless user experience across major desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) browsers, with no layout breaks.|

## 6. Design and Technical Constraints

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|**Technology Stack**|Core functionality must be implemented entirely with client-side JavaScript, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS.|
|**Design Standard**|Follow modern web design principles. The overall style must be clean and minimalist, with a focus on functionality and ample white space.|
|**Core Algorithm**|UUID generation must use the browser's built-in `crypto.randomUUID()` API to ensure cryptographic security and compliance with standards (RFC 4122, Version 4).|

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- All functional requirements listed in Section 4 are implemented and tested.
    
- All non-functional requirements described in Section 5 are met.
    
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on major browsers reveals no critical or major defects.
    
- The code is well-commented, easy to understand, and maintainable.
