### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for an online tool to generate random numbers and passwords. The core objective is to provide web users with a simple, clean, and ad-free experience.

#### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Core functionality: Online generation of customizable random passwords.
    
- Platform Adaptation: Responsive design for both desktop and mobile web browsers.
    
- Deployment: The page will be deployed as a static asset, for instance, under the `/random` directory of a Cloudflare Pages project.
    

**Out of Scope:**

- Backend Interaction: All generation logic is to be handled on the client-side. No data will be submitted to or processed by a server.
    

#### 1.3 Target Audience

- General web visitors who need to quickly obtain a random password.
    
- Software developers who require random data for development or testing purposes.
    

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Vision

"To provide a convenient, fast, and ad-free online tool for users to generate random numbers and passwords."

#### 2.2 User Characteristics

- Familiar with basic computer and mobile device operations.
    
- A primary use case is generating a password when registering for various online services.
    
- Value efficiency and desire quick access to information and task completion.
    

#### 2.3 Key Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have a device (PC or smartphone) with a modern, compatible web browser.
    

### 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

#### 3.1 User Story

**As a** user who needs to register for a new account on a website, **I want** to be able to generate a list of random passwords based on my specified quantity, length range, and character set, **so that** I can quickly choose a strong password and copy-paste it during registration.

#### 3.2 Page Style

- The overall design should adopt a Google-like style: simple, clean, functional, with ample white space.
    

#### 3.3 Feature List

|ID|Feature Name|Description|Priority|
|---|---|---|---|
|**FR001**|**Quantity to Generate**|- Allows the user to input an integer specifying how many passwords to generate. - **Constraint:** The value must be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. - **Default Value:** 5|High|
|**FR002**|**Password Length**|- Provides two input fields (for minimum and maximum length), separated by a `~` character. - The length of each generated password will be randomly determined within this range. - **Constraint:** Length values must be integers between 1 and 255, inclusive. The minimum length cannot exceed the maximum length. - **Interaction:** Each input field is equipped with up/down arrow buttons for easy value adjustment. - **Default Values:** 16 to 20|High|
|**FR003**|**Character Set**|- A textarea displays the full character set currently used for generation. - Below the textarea, four checkboxes are provided: `Numbers (0-9)`, `Lowercase (a-z)`, `Uppercase (A-Z)`, and `Common Symbols (~!@#$%^&*()_+)`. - **Linked Logic:** Checking or unchecking any box instantly updates the content of the textarea to reflect the selected combination of characters. - **Default State:** All four checkboxes are checked.|Medium|
|**FR004**|**Generate Action**|- A prominent "Generate Passwords" button is available. - **Click Logic:** 1. First, validate the inputs for `FR001` and `FR002`. 2. If inputs are invalid, clear the results area and display an error message. 3. If inputs are valid, generate the password list in the results area according to all settings.|High|
|**FR005**|**Copy Action**|- **Single Copy:** A separate copy icon button is placed to the right of each generated password, allowing for easy copying of a single line. - **Copy All:** A "Copy All" button allows the user to copy all generated results to the clipboard at once, with each password on a new line. - **User Feedback:** A brief notification (e.g., "Copied to clipboard") appears after a successful copy action.|Medium|
|**FR006**|**Description Section**|- A descriptive text section is included at the bottom of the page, explaining the tool's function, benefits, and emphasizing its client-side-only security.|Low|
|**FR007**|**Error Handling**|- When user input violates constraints (e.g., quantity or length out of range), a clear, non-intrusive error message should appear in text below the respective input field, rather than using a browser alert popup.|High|
|**FR008**|**Project Source**|- Display a GitHub icon link at the very bottom of the page, linking to the project's source code repository at `https://github.com/donald-laird/toolkit-page`.|Low|

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

|Category|Requirement Description|
|---|---|
|**Performance**|The page should load quickly, and all interactions should be responsive with no noticeable lag.|
|**Reliability**|The application must have good fault tolerance, clearly guiding the user to correct invalid inputs.|
|**Usability**|The interface must be intuitive, allowing a new user to understand its operation within seconds without guidance.|
|**Compatibility**|Must render correctly and provide a consistent, high-quality user experience across all major modern desktop and mobile browsers.|

### 5. Design Constraints

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|**Technology Stack**|Core functionality must be implemented entirely with client-side `JavaScript`, supported by `HTML` and `CSS`.|
|**Design Standards**|Adhere to modern web design principles to ensure user-friendliness and accessibility.|

### 6. Deliverables

- A package of web files ready for direct deployment to a static site hosting service like Cloudflare Pages.
